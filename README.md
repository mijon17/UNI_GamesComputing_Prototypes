# UNI_GamesComputing_Prototypes
 A Build of all game prototypees made in University Of Lincoln
 
Year 1 - Desolation - First Time making a game using Unity for Games Studies Module
 
Year 2 - 1. Poggers: Unique Mechanic: Day/Night Cycle - TASK : Create a tradition Arcade Game (Pacman,Frogger,Tetris etc) and add a unique Spin on it.
         2. C++ (First Time) - Create a Game Engine from Scratch using SDL - Simple DirectMedia Layer - Another Frogger Clone.
         3. TEAM PROJECT - Project Sanguine. Motivations: A Metroidvania/Souls Style Game with Dark Fantasy Theme.
         80% of the code was done by me as I was most experienced in the development of games from my peers mostly consisting of Computer Science Students,
         Level Design was done by another Team Mate, Audio Done By Another Peer, Working with a group consisting of 6 people including me, 3 students were absent when developing at the beginning, and were tasked
         to make up with the report. 
         Consist Of 1 Level and an Endless Mode.
         
Year 3 - 1. Final Year Dissertation Project - How Does Guided Skill Progression Affect Player Experience Vs Unguided?
This project was to test my self on making a skill system and testing how far I have come with my programming skills in Unity, though the system was simple in a sense to create it was effective as it helped to allow
non-gamers to easily understand a skill system without being overwhelemed.

The motivations were to allow the user to play through the game the first time with the freedom to choose any skill and build their experience how they want and beat the level. 
The next step was using the guided skill system being a clone of the unguided but by using popular game design techniques used in games like diablo 2, to indicate through colour
(green) to indicate the skill is the one you should pick while still having the freedom. Then evaluating the different experience when being guided vs unguided.

2. Rugby Simulation. PHYSX. - Task to create a rugby simulation with medievil elements.
